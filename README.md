[![Video Demonstration](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lfOqL9JxbLg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOqL9JxbLg)

This experience is created in 2 weeks as part of Building Virtual World at Carnegie Mellon University. 

It is a supermarket checkout simulator designed for 2 Oculus Rifts in a networked setting. There is also a crowd participation element where audiences can visualise
what each cashier is doing in real time and queue orders to submit to each of the cashiers.
